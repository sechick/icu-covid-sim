# Appendix B: Example Usage of icu-covid-sim

This ICU decision support tool for ICU capacity planning for COVID crisis is designed to support ICU capacity decisions for COVID-19 and for non-COVID unplanned patients, using tools from operations research (queue and process simulation).

The model provides statistics assuming that one set of ICU beds is reserved for COVID-19 patients, and another set of beds is reserved for non-COVID-19 patients (also called ‘Other patients’). The model is implemented in the R programming language (R Core Team 2020) using RStudio (RStudio Team 2019) and RShiny (Chang et al 2020) and is provided as is without warranty. The model was made available at https://andres-alban.shinyapps.io/icu-covid-sim/.

Parameters are entered as follows.

## Inputs to describe the model: Simplest case

Click the 'Simulate' button only AFTER all parameter values have been set. Simulation results may take up to a minute to appear.

### Parameters for COVID-19 patients.

#### Arrival rate (patients per day)

Select a lower and upper bound to test for the average arrival rate of patients per day. We understand this may vary as the pandemic evolves. This is for testing a range of values that the facility might face in terms of demand for its services.

Technical note: we assume arrivals are a Poisson process (in other words, with exponentially distributed interarrival times).

#### LOS input type.

To compute the burden on ICU resources for COVID-19 patients, specify the length of stay (LOS) distribution. This can be specified in one of two different ways.

Median (IQR): assumes a log-logistic distribution for LOS with the given median, and interquartile range (25% to 75% range)

Mean (sd): assumes a lognormal distribution for LOS, such the LOS for patients will have the given mean and standard deviation.

Default values for COVID-19 ICU length of stay distribution is based on Wuhan data. You can edit that to adapt it to your local condition.

#### Beds allocated to COVID-19 patients

Specify the range of beds under consideration for capacity expansion to handle COVID-19 patients.


### Parameters for non-COVID-19 patients.

Parameters for the ICU capacity and usage for non-COVID-19 patients is handled slightly differently. This is because these rates might be more controllable, for example by cancelling elective or nonurgent surgeries.

#### Simplest case: one stream of non-COVID-19 patients

Specify the AVERAGE arrival rate per day of non-COVID-19 patients. These are assumed to arrive as a Poisson process (exponentially distributed interarrival times), so the number of arrivals in a day varies around the specified mean rate. Poisson process makes sense under the assumption that scheduled planned surgeries are cancelled.

LOS distributions can be specified for non-COVID-19 patients with a different distribution as compared to COVID-19 patients, but with a similar interface.

You can also specify a range of number of beds for non-COVID-19 patients to test.

For the simplest scenario, we assume that all non-COVID ICU patients are unplanned urgent patients with a single statistical distribution. This may be reasonable when there all non-urgent planned elective surgeries are cancelled, for example. For the more complicated case of several streams of non-COVID patients with different statistical distributions for ICU care, please see the 'Advanced case' below.

### Capacity: 

The number of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients is specified separately from the number of ICU beds for Other patients. The assumption is that patients are routed based on COVID-19 status, so that Other patients do not use beds dedicated for COVID-19 patients and vice versa. 

### Demand from Other patients. 

The average daily arrival rate is input as a daily arrival rate. Arrivals are assumed to be spaced out with exponentially distributed inter-arrival times, which means that a Poisson random variable number of patients arrive each day. This assumption is consistent with random arrivals in a large population of independent demands for unplanned urgent (Law and Kelton 2007). 

The length of stay (LOS) distribution is specified with user input for the median and interquartile range (IQR) or the mean and standard deviation (sd). The length of stay (LOS) distribution for non-COVID patients is assumed to be log-logistic if median (IQR) is specified, or lognormal if mean (sd) is specified. LOS for individual patients is truncated at 200 days for purposes of the analysis. In the analysis reported in the paper for Amsterdam UMC, site AMC, all ICU demand for planned care was presumed to be 0 due to cancellations of procedures. Only historical urgent ICU demand patterns were modelled with a lognormal distribution with mean 4.36 and sd 8.95 (this corresponds to a log-mean 0.52 and log-sd 1.46). The model allows several patient flows for different specialisms, each with a different arrival rate, and different LOS distribution.

A base case would be to aggregate all unplanned non-COVID patients into one group of patients. (Optional advanced: To describe two or more streams of unplanned non-COVID patients, the arrival rates and length of stay distributions for those streams should be separated by commas.)

### Demand from COVID-19 patients. 

Arrival rates for COVID-19 patients are specified separately, so that the performance of the ICUs can be assessed as a function of the arrival rates and ICU bed capacity.

The LOS distributions for COVID-19 patients are assumed to be log-logistic (if median and IQR are entered) or lognormal (if mean and sd are entered) with parameters which may differ from the non-COVID patients. LOS for individual patients is truncated at 28 days for purposes of the analysis.  For the analysis reported in the paper for Amsterdam UMC, site AMC, we used data from recent literature for COVID-19 positive patients (Zhou et al 2020): LOS with median of 8 days, IQR=8 days, with log-logistic distribution capped at 28 days.

## Outputs from the model:

Click 'Simulate' once the inputs are selected. This may take a moment.

We compute outputs using theoretical results for queuing analysis (M/G/c/c queues) where possible, and otherwise compute results using Monte Carlo/stochastic simulations to estimate or to provide a sense of variation above and below theoretical mean values (Law and Kelton 2007). The outputs from the simulation model for the analysis reported in the paper are computed from steady-state simulations of 20 periods of 2 months each. The defaults model uses 20 periods of 14 days each that can be adjusted in the additional settings of the model.

Performance metrics computed include:

•	Referral rates, for each of COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 beds, defined to be the fraction of patients who need to be referred to another hospital due to capacity issues.
•	Throughput rate, for each of COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 beds, defined as the number of patients per day that can go through the system.
•	Occupancy rates, for each of COVID-19 and Non-Covid-19 beds, defined to be the fraction of beds occupied on average through time. 

Reducing the referral rate can be achieved, on average, by increasing the capacity or by decreasing the lengths of stay, for example. Statistical fluctuation can increase or decrease bed counts through time. The throughput rate increases with the arrival rate provided that enough beds are in place to maintain a low referral rate. Occupancy rates can inform decisions for initial capacity expansion plans, or for planning for potential ability to respond to additional spikes in demand.

Theoretical means are plotted together with bars that represent one standard deviation of values computed over a sequence of 2 months in the reported analysis and the user input in the online application. They are not standard errors for estimates of the means (which are computed exactly from theoretical steady-state queueing analysis). Instead, they represent variations in the patient throughput rates, fraction of occupied beds, and fraction of referrals (due to bed blocking). 

## Additional settings:

The simulations can be further controlled using several additional parameters.

### Number of periods

Number of periods says how many time periods are simulated to compute the standard deviation of the process statistics mentioned above (percent utilization, rate of ICU patients which can be treated). 

### Period length in simulation days

The period length is the number of days for which statistics for percent utilization are computed with simulations. For example, 14 days means that the average utilization, or average number of ICU patients treated, is computed over a 14 day window, for purposes of displaying variability above and below the theoretical percent utlization or number of patients treated.

## Inputs to describe the model: Advanced case

For this example, we show how to allow for multiple streams of non-COVID ICU patients who may consume non-COVID ICU bed capacity. For example, if there are multiple specialisms with continued potential demand and which have different LOS distributions.
